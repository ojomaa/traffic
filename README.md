# Traffic Sign Recognition AI

This project leverages TensorFlow and OpenCV to develop an artificial intelligence model for the identification and classification of traffic signs in photographs. The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, encompassing thousands of images that span 43 distinct types of road signs.

## Objective

The primary goal is to create a robust neural network capable of recognizing and distinguishing various road signs commonly encountered in urban and highway settings. The model will be trained to understand different sign categories such as stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more.
